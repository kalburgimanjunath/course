Step 1
WHERE DO YOU WANT 
TO BE A YEAR FROM TODAY?
Before you answer the question above, define the road you are on. Write 
a brief description about your current situation and objective. Examine the 
market environment. Identify opportunities and challenges. Consider your 
marketing plan your business’s GPS System. You need to do some critical 
thinking here.
Step 1 is all about your understanding! 
1. What is your business model and its capacity to create wealth?
2. Where will your industry be five years from today? 
3. What market opportunities do you see?
4. What are your strengths vs. weaknesses?
5. What challenges do you foresee?
6. What do you need to research, learn more about?
7. Who’s your competition and what do they offer?
8. What segments of your market are not being served?
Step2
IDENTIFY YOUR TARGET. VISUALIZE THEM 
AS INDIVIDUALS NOT AS MASSES.
Your GPS Map tells you where you are going. Step 2 tells you who you 
want to meet along the way and why they should listen. Understanding 
your ideal target helps you craft a message that is concise and specific. 
Imagine your ideal target as one person, not masses.
Step 2 is all about your target audience.
1. Write a short description of your target. Answer where he/she lives, 
what he/she drives, and what his/her values, interests, concerns, and 
ambitions are. Be detailed. You want a clear picture of your target.
2. How much do they spend with you?
3. Will they purchase from you once or many times?
4. Do they trust your type of services and products?
5. How about possible niche markets?
7. What is the $$ value of one client over a year?
8. Where do they gather?

Step3
PICK A NICHE AND AVOID 
COMMUNICATING MULTIPLE MESSAGES.
Every door leads somewhere, but not necessarily to a sale. Narrow your 
target and then narrow your message. Speaking to various needs will 
clutter your message. Small businesses need to be crisp and to the point. 
Create a short version of your message to create interest during a 
conversation and a long version for your marketing materials.
Step 3 is all about narrowing your focus! 
1. What makes you most passionate about what you offer?
2. How can you convey your passion?
3. Can you own this niche or is it large enough to sustain your business?
4. Do you have the skills to offer value to this niche market?
5. Will the market understand quickly your added value?
6. Does your business model fit this niche?
7. List how this niche market behaves: Is it seasonal sales; is it online; does it 
depend on personal relationships; how will they need to be reached?
Step4
YOUR UNIQUE VALUE IS CONNECTED TO 
YOUR ABILITY TO STAND OUT.
Most of us aren’t all that unique, right? Wrong. The services or products you 
sell may not be unique, but “how” and “why” you do it are uniquely yours. 
This is perhaps the most critical and difficult part of writing your plan—you 
have to get it right! Get feedback from clients, colleagues and objective 
friends. Communicate passion and belief in your product or services. 
Step 4 is all about differentiating yourself! 
1. What do you offer that is unique: services, skills, guarantees?
2. List 5 things you do well. Emphasize competitive advantages.
3. Are you better than the competition?
4. What undisputable value do you or could you offer?
5. Why should anyone purchase from you?
6. Could you add anything to your sale that could make you unique? 
Consider borrowing ideas from other business models!
7. Ask your clients to tell you: Why do they purchase from you? Would 
they recommend your business, and, if so, why?
Step5
YOU DON’T NEED EVERY MARKETING 
CHANNEL. PICK FEW AND MASTER THEM.
Here’s where most small businesses get it wrong. They tried direct mail and 
failed. They don’t understand online marketing, so they avoid it. They tried 
social media, but it took too much time and yielded too little results. They 
network, but can’t close a sale. Plan your marketing, but know when to 
look for help—the new economy created lots of qualified micro and small 
business consultants. Leverage them in your favor.
Step 5 is all about learning how to reach your target! 
1. Where does your target audience gather?
2. Is your product better sold online or in brick and mortar—both?
3. Identify cheap or free tools/channels you could use to market?
4. Make sure your average sale value makes sense with each channel.
5. Identify resources for marketing channels you want to learn about.
6. Start with a handful of channels and dump those that don’t work.
7. Integrate your online, print and face-to-face marketing.
8. Learn social media. Even if you hire help, you can benefit from it.

Step7
ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE BUDGET
How much is your best client worth? What would you be willing to give to 
duplicate that client? Would it be $5 or $1,000? Understanding how to set up 
a budget allows you to create a marketing system that is sustainable—nurture 
and cultivate your marketing investment by understanding your numbers.
Step 6 is all about knowing how to invest money 
to make money! 
 
1. Most businesses should set anywhere from 4 - 15 percent of gross sales 
towards marketing. However, knowing the three points below allows you 
to know how much to allocate per client acquisition and lead creation. 
a) Average Sale Value: Annual sales divided by number of transactions.
b) Average Client Value: Annual sales divided by number of clients.
c) Average Conversion Rate: Number of leads divided by closed sales.
As you are figuring out your averages, remember that 80% of your sales will 
come from 20% of your clients. Identify those and try to duplicate them.
